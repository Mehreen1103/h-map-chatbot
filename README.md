## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a document-based chatbot built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
It leverages **LangChain** for managing the retrieval and question-answering pipeline and uses a
**FAISS vector database** for efficient similarity search over embedded PDF documents.

The system retrieves relevant document chunks from the FAISS index and generates accurate,
context-aware responses through the chatbot interface built with **Streamlit**.
